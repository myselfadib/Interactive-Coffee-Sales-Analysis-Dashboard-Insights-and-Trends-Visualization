![alt text](
This Coffee Sales Dashboard project is crafted to analyze and visualize coffee sales data effectively, allowing for detailed insights into sales trends over time, sales distribution by country, and key customer engagement. This dashboard was designed using Microsoft Excel 2019, incorporating advanced functionalities to overcome the absence of the XLOOKUP feature.

## Key Features and Tools Used:
### Data Retrieval:
- Utilized the INDEX MATCH functions extensively to fetch and merge data from multiple sheets. This method ensured accurate data pulling into the dashboard for analysis despite the limitation of not having XLOOKUP in Excel 2019.

### Data Visualization:
- Each graph and visualization in the dashboard is generated from a separate pivot table, tailored to display various dimensions and measures such as sales over time and sales by country.

### Interactive Components:
-  Integrated slicers and a timeline provide dynamic filtering options, allowing for an interactive experience where users can customize the data display to their preferences.
### Enhanced Visualization:
- Aesthetic enhancements were applied to the visualizations to make the data more accessible and easier to understand at a glance.

### Key Insights:
- The Coffee Sales Dashboard reveals notable fluctuations in coffee sales over time, with significant volatility observed among different coffee types such as Arabica and Robusta. This may reflect seasonal variations or supply chain constraints. The United States emerges as a dominant market, substantially outperforming other regions like Ireland and the United Kingdom, which underscores its importance as a target market for focused marketing and sales strategies. Additionally, the sales data indicates a balanced distribution among the top customers, suggesting a stable customer base without over-reliance on any single buyer. These insights are crucial for optimizing supply chain operations, enhancing marketing efforts in key regions, and maintaining robust customer relationships to support ongoing business stability and growth.


### Usage:
- This dashboard is an essential tool for business analysts and sales strategists in the coffee industry. It is designed to provide a clear and concise overview of sales data, helping teams to track performance and adjust operations accordingly.
